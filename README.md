# Bachelor's Degree
This is the work I did for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Genoa (2024). I extended a work I did in the <a href="https://github.com/saracaviglia/IDS">Introduction to Data Science course</a>, so it was based on the same <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fcpercival/160k-spotify-songs-sorted?select=data.csv">Kaggle</a> dataset.<br>
You can also find a PDF in Italian with a description of the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm and my results.
